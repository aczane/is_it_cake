I'm an analyst living in the great DC metro area of the United States. 

I earned my Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Washington, doing solid-state NMR, because solving NMR spectra and peptide structure is kind of like solving puzzles, and I like puzzles.

Then I moved to do a post-doc in epidemiology and clinical MRI, because NMR is also pretty much the same as MRI, except...on people. This is where I had to learn R, and I decided that I like this kind of puzzle (figuring out how to script answers to questions), too. And, voila.

Outside of work, I like to climb and hang upside down (from silks, lyras, other aerial apparatus). I also bake, herd and am herded by our two dogs, and knit.
