```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE)
```

A [recent blog post from Edwin Thoen]("https://edwinth.github.io/blog-new-things/"), suggesting that we blog about things we just learned, prompted me to write this post, because I think that there is some benefit to seeing how other people learn, and to following examples created by others who are not ninja-level experts. 

I spent yesterday putting together some slides at work, using the [xaringan]("https://github.com/yihui/xaringan") package. I largely followed the examples in [Yihui's slide deck]("https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/"), the [wiki]("https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki"), and [Alison's slide deck and code]("https://alison.rbind.io/post/r-ladies-slides/s"). I have *very* limited experience in CSS - I've made a flask app in Python for a project, but in general CSS makes me want to throw things and eat my computer, so...that's where I started from. But at the end of the day, I had a basic slide set with R-generated tables, so I thought maybe I could reproduce that here, for anyone who wants to hit the ground running with very limited prior knowledge.

The documentation is all there, and theoretically you should read it all, but I tend to learn best by doing; I'll run through the basics so that I understand where to start, but I find it the most helpful to see the .Rmd and the final output, and learn that way.

1. Download [xaringan]("https://github.com/yihui/xaringan"). I work in RStudio, so my instructions and example will be specific to this method. You can install it with:

```{r}
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```

2. To create a new presentation:<br/>
File > New File > R Markdown > From Template > Ninja Presentation

3. This generates a new .Rmd file - it is the .Rmd that creates [Yihui's slide deck]("https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/"). So, if you have the .Rmd open and the slide deck open (or just use the **Infinite Moon Reader** Add-in and render it in RStudio viewer/html), you can see what code pieces correspond to slide output elements. 

4. In the YAML, you would start with the default:
```{r}
---
title: "Presentation Ninja"
subtitle: "⚔<br/>with xaringan"
author: "Yihui Xie"
date: "2016/12/12"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
---
```

This will format your title slide.
I edited it this way:
```{r}
---
title: "Title Goes Here"
author: "Ariel C. Zane<br/>More Lines Here"
date: "March 2, 2018"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    # to change color schemes, add this line below
    # to incorporate customized css
    {{css: ["default", "new-color.css", "default-fonts.css"]}}
    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
---
```

Here's the difference:

![](/img/comparison_title.png)


My understanding is that the default CSS doesn't explicitly need to be called unless you want to modify it - Yihui gives the explanation [here]("https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki"). The "default" .css file appears once you render the .Rmd, along with the default-fonts.css file (some other files also appear: the libs folder and everything in it, and .html output of your .Rmd). 

They take effect in this order:<br/> 
default < new-color.css < default-fonts.css

If you want to overwrite only chunks of it (here, I changed colors in new-color.css, and fonts in default-fonts.css), be mindful of the order. You could also presumably edit the default.css.

I used [http://www.color-hex.com]("http://www.color-hex.com") to find colors. For my work presentation, I just used basic black and white colors, but here I changed them so that the difference was more marked.[^1]

Contents of **new-color.css**:
```{css}
/*
h1, h2, h3 - font colors for the different headers; removed text shadow
*/

h1, h2, h3 {
  font-weight: normal;
  color: #eb6d13;
  text-shadow: none;
}

/*
for any links
*/

a, a > code {
  color: #eb6d13;
}

/*
highlight color for inline code; 
the rgba takes red, green, blue, alpha arguments
*/
.remark-code-line-highlighted { background-color: rgba(19, 108, 235 0.3); }

/* background color and headers, code, etc., colors for .inverse class slides (e.g., title)
*/

.inverse {
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
}
.inverse, .inverse h1, .inverse h2, .inverse h3, .inverse a, inverse a > code {
  color: #E7165F;
}

```

5. To edit and create your slides, you'll first want to set your code preferences. 

I didn't set eval = FALSE because I wanted to run tables that would be included in my code.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, echo = FALSE)
```

Then you can start with your first (non-title) slide.
```{r}

```

# The --- denotes a new slide here
# The "#" will be the header for that slide
---
# This is the first slide!

--

- You can have elements appear in succession, versus all at once

--

- Like this

[^1]: I will add that when I tried to edit .css files in RStudio, after using Infinite Moon Reader to live preview the slides, any extra .css files I created (e.g., new-color.css, default-fonts.css)] DISAPPEARED. I don't understand the work behind the scenes and this black magic...so I just used my favorite .css editor, [Atom]("https://atom.io").
