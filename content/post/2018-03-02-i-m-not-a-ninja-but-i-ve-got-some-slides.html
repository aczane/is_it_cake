<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: the slides rendered at the bottom don’t seem to work well on mobile (iPhone) or Safari, currently. It’s been tested on Chrome and works well there.*</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="https://edwinth.github.io/blog-new-things/">recent blog post from Edwin Thoen</a>, suggesting that we blog about things we just learned, prompted me to write this post, because I think that there is some benefit to seeing how other people learn, and to following examples created by others who are not ninja-level experts.</p>
<p>I spent yesterday putting together some slides at work, using the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan">xaringan</a> package. I largely followed the examples in <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/">Yihui’s slide deck</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/r-ladies-slides/">Alison’s slide deck and code</a>. These were <strong>wonderful</strong> and really got me up and running quickly.</p>
<p>I have <em>very</em> limited experience in CSS - I’ve made a flask app in Python for a project, but in general CSS makes me want to throw things and eat my computer, so…that’s where I started from. But at the end of the day, I had a basic slide set with R-generated tables, so I thought maybe I could reproduce that here, for anyone who wants to hit the ground running with very limited prior knowledge of xaringan.</p>
<p>The documentation is all there, and theoretically you should read it all, but I tend to learn best by doing; I’ll run through the basics so that I understand where to start, but I find it the most helpful to dive into the .Rmd and the final output, and learn that way. Then it’s handy to have the resources afterward so that I can troubleshoot.</p>

<h2>Let’s Get Started</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan">xaringan</a>. I work in RStudio, so my instructions and example will be specific to this method. You can install it with:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&#39;yihui/xaringan&#39;)</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To create a new presentation:<br/> File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown &gt; From Template &gt; Ninja Presentation</p></li>
<li><p>This generates a new .Rmd file - it is the .Rmd that creates <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/">Yihui’s slide deck</a>. So, if you have the .Rmd open and the slide deck open (or just use the <strong>Infinite Moon Reader</strong> Add-in and render it in RStudio viewer/html), you can see what code pieces correspond to slide output elements.</p></li>
<li><p>In the YAML, you would start with the default:</p></li>

title: &quot;Presentation Ninja&quot;
subtitle: &quot;⚔&lt;br/&gt;with xaringan&quot;
author: &quot;Yihui Xie&quot;
date: &quot;2016/12/12&quot;
output:

      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false

<p>This will format your title slide. I edited it this way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>---
title: &quot;Title Goes Here&quot;
author: &quot;Ariel C. Zane&lt;br/&gt;More Lines Here&quot;
date: &quot;March 2, 2018&quot;
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    # to change color schemes, add this line below
    # to incorporate customized css
    css: [&quot;default&quot;, &quot;new-color.css&quot;, &quot;default-fonts.css&quot;]
    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
---</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the difference:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/comparison_title.png" />

</div>
<p>My understanding is that the default CSS doesn’t explicitly need to be called unless you want to modify it - Yihui gives the explanation <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki">here</a>. The “default” .css file appears once you render the .Rmd, along with the default-fonts.css file (some other files also appear: the libs folder and everything in it, and .html output of your .Rmd).</p>
<p>They take effect in this order:<br/> default &lt; new-color.css &lt; default-fonts.css</p>
<p>If you want to overwrite only chunks of it (here, I changed colors in new-color.css, and fonts in default-fonts.css), be mindful of the order. You could also presumably edit the default.css.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.color-hex.com" class="uri">http://www.color-hex.com</a> to find colors. For my work presentation, I just used basic black and white colors, but here I changed them so that the difference was more marked.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Contents of <strong>new-color.css</strong>:</p>
<pre class="css"><code>/*
h1, h2, h3 - font colors for the different headers; removed text shadow
*/

h1, h2, h3 {
  font-weight: normal;
  color: #eb6d13;
  text-shadow: none;
}

/*
for any links
*/

a, a &gt; code {
  color: #eb6d13;
}

/*
highlight color for inline code; 
the rgba takes red, green, blue, alpha arguments
*/
.remark-code-line-highlighted { background-color: rgba(19, 108, 235 0.3); }

/* background color and headers, code, etc., colors for .inverse class slides (e.g., title)
*/

.inverse {
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
}
.inverse, .inverse h1, .inverse h2, .inverse h3, .inverse a, inverse a &gt; code {
  color: #E7165F;
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>From here, it’s mostly like working with an R Markdown file. To edit and create your slides, you’ll first want to set your code preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t set <code>eval = FALSE</code> up here in the overall options because I wanted to run tables that would be included in my code. For later chunks that I didn’t want to be evaluated, I just added <code>eval = FALSE</code> where necessary.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/chunk_options.png" />

</div>
<p>Then you can start with your first (non-title) slide. The syntax is all Pandoc markdown, which you can use the handy <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf">R Markdown cheat sheet for</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>---
# This is the first slide!

--

- You can have elements appear in succession, versus all at once

--

- Like this

--

- And this

--

- This is a [link](http://tumblr.tastefullyoffensive.com/post/171451780306/squirrel-eats-doughnut#.WpmF52aZOSM) (it me!)</code></pre>
<p>And this is what you would get, ultimately (although each bullet would appear with successive advances - you can see it in the full slide deck at the bottom of the post):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/first_slide.png" />

</div>
<p>If you want to suppress the message of an evaluated chunk, add <code>message = FALSE</code>: <img src="/img/message_false.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to display tables, use format = ‘html’ in <code>knitr::kable</code>. I also used the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html">kableExtra</a> package to add a little more customization.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_set &lt;-
  mtcars %&gt;%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp, hp, drat, wt)

knitr::kable(head(), format = &#39;html&#39;) %&gt;%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size = 8)</code></pre>
<p>So the slide .Rmd would look like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/slide_rmd.png" />

</div>
<p>If you wanted to center it, add this to the top:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>---
  class: center</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/center_comp.png" />

</div>
<p>And if you want to use the formatting for the title slide (here it doesn’t matter, because all of my backgrounds are white), you would add class: inverse.</p>
</div>
<div id="we-did-it" class="section level2">
<h2>We did it!</h2>
<p>That’s it! My goal was to help convince you that you could go from 0 to slide deck in a very short amount of time; hopefully this helped. I shared the .html outputs with team members via email; they opened it with a browser and everything worked perfectly. I wasn’t able to save it to pdf from a browser very well, though - it created 8x11 formatted files and didn’t preserve the 4:3 ratio. I looked at some of the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Export-Slides-to-PDF">documentation</a> about that, but it was the end of the day and I didn’t get very far. If anyone has tips, let me know!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I will add that when I tried to edit .css files in RStudio, after using Infinite Moon Reader to live preview the slides, any extra .css files I created (e.g., new-color.css, default-fonts.css)] DISAPPEARED. I don’t understand the work behind the scenes and this black magic…so I just used my favorite .css editor, <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I can’t for the life of me figure out how to put chunks in chunks…this is getting a little too meta, guys.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I followed <a href="https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/embed-slides-knitr-blogdown/">directions for embedding slide decks into blogdown posts from Tim Mastny here</a>. If you want it to work in Safari, you do need to add the #1 to the url of your slides, or else it will not work. E.g., <code>knitr::include_url('https://aczane.netlify.com/slides/xaringan_example_acz.html#1')</code><a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
