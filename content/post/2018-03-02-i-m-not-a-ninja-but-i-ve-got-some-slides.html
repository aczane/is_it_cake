<p>A <a href="%22https://edwinth.github.io/blog-new-things/%22">recent blog post from Edwin Thoen</a>, suggesting that we blog about things we just learned, prompted me to write this post, because I think that there is some benefit to seeing how other people learn, and to following examples created by others who are not ninja-level experts.</p>
<p>I spent yesterday putting together some slides at work, using the <a href="%22https://github.com/yihui/xaringan%22">xaringan</a> package. I largely followed the examples in <a href="%22https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/%22">Yihui’s slide deck</a>, the <a href="%22https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki%22">wiki</a>, and <a href="%22https://alison.rbind.io/post/r-ladies-slides/s%22">Alison’s slide deck and code</a>. I have <em>very</em> limited experience in CSS - I’ve made a flask app in Python for a project, but in general CSS makes me want to throw things and eat my computer, so…that’s where I started from. But at the end of the day, I had a basic slide set with R-generated tables, so I thought maybe I could reproduce that here, for anyone who wants to hit the ground running with very limited prior knowledge.</p>
<p>The documentation is all there, and theoretically you should read it all, but I tend to learn best by doing; I’ll run through the basics so that I understand where to start, but I find it the most helpful to see the .Rmd and the final output, and learn that way.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download <a href="%22https://github.com/yihui/xaringan%22">xaringan</a>. I work in RStudio, so my instructions and example will be specific to this method. You can install it with:</p></li>
<li><p>To create a new presentation:<br/> File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown &gt; From Template &gt; Ninja Presentation</p></li>
<li><p>This generates a .Rmd file</p></li>
