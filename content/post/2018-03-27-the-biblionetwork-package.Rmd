```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE)
```

After the high of rstudio::conf 2018, I made a (tiny) list of R-related goals for myself:

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '960859452244099072')
```

Happily, I was able to knock the [second one](https://aczane.netlify.com/2018/02/08/the-first-and-namesake-post-is-it-cake/) out back in February, but the first one has taken more work. 

The `biblionetwork` package has just two functions, currently. They are (so creatively named, you guys):
`make_edgelist` : creates edgelists in dataframe format
`make_nodelist` : creates nodelists in dataframe format

I'm not sure if a package already exists out there that performs these functions, but I couldn't find one when I first started working with co-occurrence lists and networks. I did find a great example from [Francois Briatte](https://www.r-bloggers.com/turning-keywords-into-a-co-occurrence-network/), which I was able to modify for my work. I've since changed the script even further, and benchmarked my various versions to gauge speed: [^1]

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '973903870366814209')
```

Mind you, it's still not very fast (especially for very large networks, ~10^4^ nodes and >= 10^6^ edges). But it works!

[**Update, 2018/03/30**
I'm updating this post to use the [`fivethirtyeight`](http://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/index.html) package from [Albert](http://rudeboybert.rbind.io), [Chester](http://chester.rbind.io), and [Jennifer](https://twitter.com/jchunn206). Install the package and call the dataset to use it as shown.]

I'm going to walk through it with the "Candy" dataset from [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com). This is a dataset of candy types, with a bunch of variables describing the candies, like "chocolate," "fruity," and so on; the full description of the data can be found [here](http://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/articles/fivethirtyeight.html) in the package reference, and [here on the fivethirtyeight data site](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking). We're going to rework it a little bit and create a network graph of the candies; candy with similar traits should be closer to each other and linked. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# load the data from the fivethirtyeight package 

install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
library(fivethirtyeight)

dat <- fivethirtyeight::candy_rankings

# check it out

head(dat)
```

```{r eval = TRUE, message = F, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

library(fivethirtyeight)

dat <- fivethirtyeight::candy_rankings 

head(dat)
```
Let's also remove the "one dime" and "one quarter" entries, because...that's not food. (They discuss this in the article.)
```{r eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

dat %<>%
  filter(!competitorname %in% c("One dime", "One quarter"))

# how many distinct candies are there?
n_distinct(dat$competitorname)
```
The descriptive columns in the fivethirtyeight package version of this dataset are logical variables - "TRUE" indicating "yes," this is "chocolate," and "FALSE" if it is not. We're going to change this coding a little bit and create text instead. There is probably a more elegant way of doing this, but messing with extracting and looping over colnames is something I don't want to touch with a long stick, so...

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

# create new columns with text instead of binary coding

dat_labels <-
  dat %>%
  mutate(choc_lab = ifelse(chocolate, "chocolate", NA),
         fruit_lab = ifelse(fruity, "fruity", NA),
         car_lab = ifelse(caramel, "caramel", NA),
         pea_lab = ifelse(peanutyalmondy,
                                 "peanutyalmondy", NA),
         nou_lab = ifelse(nougat, "nougat", NA),
         crisp_lab = ifelse(crispedricewafer ,
                                   "crispedricewafer", NA),
         hard_lab = ifelse(hard , "hard", NA),
         bar_lab = ifelse(bar, "bar", NA),
         plu_lab = ifelse(pluribus, "pluribus", NA)) 

# and check

head(dat_labels)

```
Now! We're going to reshape this. What we ultimately want is a single descriptor column that has concatenated text. Theoretically, we could use `dplyr::unite()`, but it doesn't handle NAs well, so we'll do it a slightly messier way. We'll start with `dplyr::gather()`.

```{r eval = TRUE, message = F, echo = TRUE}
# trim columns from dat_labels

dat_labels %<>%
  select(-c(2:13))

# turn to long format, removing NA rows
dat_long <- gather(dat_labels, key = type, value = descriptor, 2:10, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  select(-type)

# now create a final column that concatenates all candies that share certain descriptors

candy <- aggregate(competitorname ~ descriptor, data = dat_long, paste, collapse = ",")

```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

knitr::kable(head(candy), format = 'html') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size = 8)
```

OKAY. We now have a dataframe that shows, for every candy descriptor, the full list of candies that have that characteristic. E.g., for "chocolate," it shows: "100 Grand, 3 Musketeers, Almond Joy, Baby Ruth, Charleston Chew (wut?), Hershey's Krackel, Hershey's Milk Chocolate," and so on. 

Now we can finally get to more fun stuff. I mean, I guess that was fun. But I'm itching to share my "biblionetwork" package!

It's hosted on my [github](https://github.com/aczane/biblionetwork):

Install from github and load the package.
```{r eval = FALSE, message = F, echo = TRUE}

# install from github (install_packages("devtools") first if necessary)
devtools::install_github("aczane/biblionetwork")

# load the library
library(biblionetwork)

```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(biblionetwork)
```

As I mentioned above, it has two functions: `make_nodelist`, and `make_edgelist`.
First, we will want to create the nodelist.
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

# create the list of nodes - this is essentially the list of candies, one per row, in a tidy way.
nodes <- make_nodelist(candy, competitorname, sep = ",")

head(nodes)

# and now make the edgelist. This connects nodes that share candy types. This is an undirected network, so edge pairs (i,j) and (j,i) are equivalent. 

edges <- make_edgelist(candy, competitorname, sep = ",")

head(edges)
```
So if two candies share two attributes, they should have an edge weight of two; if they share three attributes, their edge weight should be three.

And now, the network graph! We'll try out [`tidygraph`](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/) and [`ggraph`](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph).[^2]

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("tidygraph")
install.packages("thomasp85/ggraph")

library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```

We'll want one of the original data columns as a node attribute: [winpercent](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/). We also want to make a new attribute, which I'll just call "complexity:" a scale indicating how many of the descriptors each candy has. That is, if it's "chocolate" and "peanutyalmondy" and "nougat" (like "Baby Ruth" or "Snickers", it will have complexity >= 3 (in this case, both are also "caramel", so it'd be "4."))
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# sum the first six columns of the original dataset: chocolate, fruity, caramel, peanutyalmondy, nougat, crispedricewafer. What is the range?

dat %<>%
  mutate(complexity = chocolate + fruity + caramel + peanutyalmondy + nougat + crispedricewafer)

range(dat$complexity)

# join the attributes to the nodes df
nodes <-
  nodes %>%
  left_join(dat[,c(1,13,14)], by = "competitorname")

# now create the graph object
cg <- tbl_graph(edges = edges, nodes = nodes, directed = FALSE)

summary(cg)

cg

```
So now we have a graph object that has nodes, node attributes (winpercent and complexity), and edges, with edge weights.

So let's plot this!

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# and let's plot

# color scheme 
cols <- c("dodgerblue1", "tomato1", "goldenrod1", "springgreen1", "purple")

# now the ggraph
ggraph(cg, layout = 'fr') + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = weight), edge_colour = "gray54",
                show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = winpercent, alpha = winpercent, 
                      color = as.factor(complexity))) +
  labs(title = "Candy Network by Complexity and Win %") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = competitorname), size = 2.5, 
                 colour = 'black', repel = TRUE, 
                 check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_alpha_continuous(range = c(0.1, 0.9), name = "Win %") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,10), name = "Win %") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Candy Complexity", values = cols) +
  theme_void()
```
And this is pretty much what you would expect! Similar candies are connected by edges.

The chocolate candy bars are all together, interconnected. Midway through you get chocolate pluribus candies like M&Ms, and then you get into fruitier candies on the other side, which all tend to be pluribus (and erm, where my heart lies). You also see that the fruity candies tend not to be so complex (at least on this scale), but people still like them, whereas the more popular chocolate candies tend to rate higher in complexity.

And finally, your reminder that you can't always trust a simple graph. I love Haribo Happy Cola. But what is it next to?

CANDY CORN?? THE HORROR.

Anyway, there it is! Let me know if you try out the package and find it helpful, or lacking, or anything at all! For more handy network resources, check out:

[^1]:[Alexej's post](http://www.alexejgossmann.com/benchmarking_r/) is extremely helpful for benchmarking, btw.
[^2]: For really large networks (10^4^ nodes and >=10^7^ edges), I find [`ggnetwork`](https://briatte.github.io/ggnetwork/) to work a little better, though it requires more tweaking...I've gotten the bomb of doom a little too often with tidygraph and ggraph on very large datasets. I'm not sure why this is. I will confess that I haven't put too much time into it as I have lots of working code written for ggnetwork.
